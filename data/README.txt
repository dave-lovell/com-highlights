`com-highlights/data` contains all the data used as part of the com-highlights project.

### Inputs

'inputs' includes all the initial inputs not generated by the project itself:

* Census data
* CARU's internal data on Centres of Mission (Recording the Journey)
* Parish data from research and statistics

Most (all?) of this data won't be stored in the remote repository. Much of it will be either manually updated, or loaded from shared drives via processes in `processes/project-initiation'

### Intermediate

'intermediate' contains data generated by the project and used again by another process, such as visualisations pertaining to each CoM which can be added to output documents.
