This readme is _mostly_ just to get this folder pushed to the Github upstream, but while we're here:

`processes/project-initiation` is a directory for all the **code** (i.e. '.R', '.Rmd', '.qmd') that we use initiate the project workspace. This probably just includes the creation of directories and file structures, but it might also include the processes by which we load data into repository (e.g. initial loading of data from shared drives which is not to be uploaded to Github)
