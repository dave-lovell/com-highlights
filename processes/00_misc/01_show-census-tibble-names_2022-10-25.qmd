There are lots of different column names for the various tibbles we have. Each nation has a different naming convention, and there is some variation between the levels of the names. This document shows all the names

```{r showNames}
library(purrr)
library(here)

census_tibbles <- readRDS(
  here("data", "intermediate", "census", "merged-data",
       "02_grouped-by-level-and-nation_2022-10-25.RDS")
)

census_names <- map(census_tibbles, map, map, names)

census_names
```
